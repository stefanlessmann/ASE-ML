Apart from providing support to write Python codes and interact with the Python ecosystem, Colab also allows you to execute your code on the Google Cloud.\n","\n","The big advantage for our course is that you do not need to install any software to your computer. Therefore, using Colab is a very simple and user-friendly way to start with Python and Machine Learning.

Prior to using the methods in some library, you need to *import* the corresponding library. The following example illustrates how to do this by importing some common libraries for machine learning.\n","<br><br>\n","- Run the code in the following cell. \n","- Next, explore how you can use the methods provided in the libraries and how Colab supports you in that quest. Create a new coding cell and type `np.` After a little while, Colab should display a tool tip, which informs you what methods are available. Their names might appear somewhat cryptic at first glance. - Select the method `arange()` from the list. Your code cell should now comprise the statement `np.arange()`. \n","- Move the mouse over this statement to explore the description of the method, also called *docstring* in Python. Check whether you find the docstring informative. What functionality does the `arange` method provide?\n"],"metadata":{"id":"SGd0PIga0AAa"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"h6vhKogUqLQY"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Standard libraries for data data handling and plotting\n","import numpy as np \n","import seaborn as sns\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import pandas as pd\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Playing with the arange method...\n"],"metadata":{"id":"IIoWvVtTIr-5"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Generating synthetic data for supervised learning using the sklearn library\n","Supervised learning requires labeled data.
